Victor Vasarely is a man of art. He is world famous for his unique style. Although he died in 1997, his very own museum opened up in 1976. Most people say that his art was born in the museum. He himself organized other artist's work by their uniqueness and their distinct style. A zebra, styled carpet is one of the biggest attractions in the museum. It was a kinetic experiment that represents space movement time and space illusionism. In total, his artworks were exhibited for almost three decades.

Bridget Riley has a very unique art form. She uses geometric abstractions to give the art spice and to put thought into the viewers' mind. Her art inspires the spark of other art. For example, her wavy art image sparked an idea for the strong waves of musicians. She also has many other art forms. One set of paintings are black and white, but the other set is full of colors. She likes to be diverse in colors. 

Casey Reas is a software artist. He thinks that software is the natural medium. I think that means that the software is "normal drawing" for him. He likes to sketch first, allowing his ideas to evolve. His art is not only still, but they move around, adding spice and thought to the viewers' mind. Some create a cool overall image. One of his paintings originates from one single white line, into what looks like a long splat of milk. He also uses color to bring out emotions and feelings. He explained that in films, the sound creates how the viewer should feel. Casey Reas uses color to create how the viewer should feel about his type of art. 

Josef Albers is an art teacher in Germany. He is known to use a great amount of color within his paintings. He is also renowned to use minimal means to demonstrate an extraordinary effect. On one of his paintings, I first thought that the paint was see-through. Then the narrator explained that he uses shades in his art, creating the translucency of his paint. This creates movement throughout the viewers' eyes, and throughout the colors.

Andy Warhol also has a unique style of art. Most of his paintings are real-life images. For example, he likes to paint pictures of people, soup cans, soap boxes, etc. Not only does he draw the person, for example, he also adds more detail. For his Michael Jackson painting, Andy painted his hair to where (from a viewers' perspective) the left side of his hair is red, and the color slowly fades to orange as you look to the right side of his hair. He outlined it so that Michael still has his natural hair color, but the color adds taste. The video also mentioned that the painting of Michael Jackson's face looks as if someone is wearing a mask. In my elementary school, we would watch many fun videos of Andy Warhol. the first painting that I witnessed was the famous Campbell's Chicken Soup.

Kehinde Wiley has a cultural syle in his art. As I watched the video, I witnessed that he likes to draw about his own race. He also explained that by thecharacteristics of the person, whether they are wearing something, or holding something, you can tell their origin. He also like to add realistic objects and color in his paintings. Another style that Kehinde had stain-glass. He combined religious cultures with his style of art. This is one of my most favorite artists. He cares bout his race, and devotes his art to them. He is very generous, humble and wise. He understands what they go through.
