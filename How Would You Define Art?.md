I think that art has many purposes. It can be used to trigger thoughts, and for entertainment. Art comes in many forms. From a splat of paint to a masterpiece, art can be diverse. Different religions can have different styles of art. In my experience, the American religion is much different from the Vietnamese religion. The Vietnamese style mainly focuses on slow, peaceful music. It may not seem like it, but music is an art also.
