(Before) I think that art has many purposes. It can be used to trigger thoughts, and for entertainment. Art comes in many forms. From a splat of paint to a masterpiece, art can be diverse. Different religions can have different styles of art. In my experience, the American religion is much different from the Vietnamese religion. The Vietnamese style mainly focuses on slow, peaceful music. It may not seem like it, but music is an art also.

(After) I think that art has value. In the video, people were hating on art masterpieces. They do not understand the purpose of why it is there. They think that it is just there for a space to put it. Really, the artist wants people to analyze it and give it their thoughts. They can also use it for further art ideas. In my opinion, art is dynamic. Like I mentioned above, art can come in many ways. People just need to appreciate them. I feel that art is progressing towards a more modern era. There are still some back-then art, but modern art is taking over. For example, in music, new styles of songs are releasing like crazy. Although this might seem overwhelming, there are still some people who listen to the 1800s music or the 1900s music.it really all depends on the person's interests.
