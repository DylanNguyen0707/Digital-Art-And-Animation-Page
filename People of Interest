Victor Vasarely is a man of art. He is world famous for his unique style. Although he died in 1997, his very own museum opened up in 1976. Most people say that his art was born in the museum. He himself organized other artist's work by their uniqueness and their distinct style. A zebra, styled carpet is one of the biggest atractions in the museum. It was a kinetic experiment that represents space movement time and space illusionism. In total, his artworks were exhibited for almost three decades.
